-------------------------Tora's Inner thoughts--------------------------
Tora: Rex told me to come see him after I escaped. We've been partners for a long time but did he have something to do with all of this? 

Tora: There's a note sticking out over there by the desk ...
Tora: I should check it out.

-------------------------Clues ---------------------------
Rex: Large transfers were made using Tora's account on xyz. The money was transferred to an untraceable account overseas. The next day, he was apprehended by Phoe ... 
Rex: So the real questions is, where did all that money go?

Rex: According to my investigation, it looked like someone mishandled the evidence. It was reported that $1.5 million was missing from Gaming Corp but yesterday they said they couldn't account for $2 million.
Rex: Ever since you've been locked up, Phoe has been acting weird. She sent the team to remote locations near the prison and also to areas near the bank and your case was closed immediately after your sentence. 
Rex: She sent us over to "watch" over these areas, but it was almost like we were guarding it ... from someone ...
