Draco: Welcome to Draco’s Store, today only fresh antelope meat 50% off!
Draco: Hey friend, what're you doing here? I thought you were in Jail?!
Draco: These past few months have been rough. The landlord raised my rent and I had to request a loan from the bank. 
Draco: They decline me but I found another way to get some money. Now my store is still up and running, isn't that great!

------------------------Tora's Inner thoughts ---------------------------------

Tora: I need to find a way to get a look at the register.

Tora: I have to take down that wanted poster before he sees!

Tora: I should check the register while Draco is preoccupied.

------------------------Clues-----------------------

Tora: There’s a message from Chief Phoe, I should take a look.
Tora: It says:
“Draco, I accept your offer. You give me the $200,000 and I’ll take care of the rest. - Chief Phoe”
Tora: Hmmm, maybe there’s something else on here.
Tora: It looks like they set up a meeting the night before my arrest. That explains where that money came from.
