-------------- Tora's inner thoughts -----------------------
Tora: I need to find some info on those four suspects. I know someone must have paid off the city counsel to keep quiet. If only I could get my hand on those bank statments... 

Tora: I made it to the computer room but now I need something to save the bank statement files. I need evidence to prove my innocence. 

Tora: There's a key pad lock on the door. Got to find the passcode before I can get in...

-------------- Clues ------------------
Bank Worker: The computer room holds all the bank statements for everyone in the city! I think the room was somewhere near the top floor. 

Alan: *Yawn* It's been a long week. I barely got any sleep last night...
Alan: Steve asked me to grab some documents from the computer room. I already forgot the combination. It was something like: 5 * * *  
Alan:I should really ask Steve again. *Yawn*
Alan: Wait, who are you again?    

Marla: Hi, my name's Marla. Today's my first day on the job! 
Marla: I've just been running around doing errands for Steve. I saw him enter the computer room earlier and caught a glimpse of the code. 
Marla: It was something like: * * * 1  
Marla: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more errands to do. 

Robby: *Thinking out loud* The passcode to the computer room is very important! That's why I only know one number: * 7 * *   
Robby: *Thinking out loud* There could be a lot of trouble if someone broke into the computer room. I should be careful with who I talk to...     

Laci: The computer room has guards watching the entrance 24/7. No one's getting in there without being detected.
Laci: The guards keep telling each other the third number is * * 2 *  
Laci: I don't really get what they mean though.

Bank Worker: All supplies can be found on the top floor, but you should have known that since you work here.  

Bank Worker: The computer room is up ahead.  

-------------- Random Text -------------
Bank Worker: Hey, you very look familiar. Almost like the guy who just escaped jail...   

Bank Worker: I thought we only hired one intern but since you're here can you grab me a coffee?   

Bank Worker: I feel safer with the guards around. 

Bank Worker: You're running out of time. Better hurry ... 

Bank Worker: Is it 5 yet? I'm ready to leave.

Bank Worker: This place is huge! Even I get lost sometimes. 

--------------- Flash Drive -----------------
Tora: I should take this ... might need it later ...
