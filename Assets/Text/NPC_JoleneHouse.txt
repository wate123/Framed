Joline’s House Dialogue:

------------------------Tora's Inner thoughts ---------------------------------

Tora: I need to find some clues around here.

Tora: This must be her safe, I should see what’s inside.

Tora: It looks like I need to find the combination to the safe.

------------------------Clues-----------------------

Tora: Looks like her diary, there must be a clue to the safe’s combination inside here, but it’s got a combination of its own. I should look around for a clue to her diary combination.

Tora: Jolene keeps her clothing neatly in this drawer. I count 4 sweather in the first pocket, 7 shirts in the second pocket, and 5 shorts in the third pocket. I wonder if that means something? ....

Tora: The diary opened and it seems the last 2 pages are ripped out. What could this mean? ...

Tora: Woah, there’s loads of expensive equipment in here. It looks like she was doing an investigation of her own into Draco and Phoe. It looks like she has been tracking their various dealings for the past 5 years.

*Recording from Jolene’s File* 
Draco: I’ll give you $200,000 to help me bring this case under. I need the money to keep my store open and you need the money for your family. 
Phoe: Don’t worry I’ll handle it. Have the money ready by tomorrow afternoon.
