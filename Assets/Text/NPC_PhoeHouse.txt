------------------------Tora's Inner thoughts ---------------------------------
Right now Chief Phoe looks suspicious. I have to check her place out but I need to hurry before she gets back. 



------------------------Clues-----------------------
Tora: What?! This bag has almost $200,000 inside! I'm not a math major but it's obvious the Chief stole some of the money and framed me. 
Tora: But there's still $300,0000 out there somewhere ... Where did that money go? ...  

Tora: There's take out from Draco's and files on Rex under the bed. I should pay those two a visit next.
